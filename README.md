<h3>Running Tests</h3>
Hello, I have pre-installed all the required environment for running the tests. You can now execute the tests in the console by the following commands:

To run test <br>
`mvn test`

Unfortunately, I'm still having a hard time generating the report using Maven. So I couldn't really show the report :(

Thanks
